##Helpful Commands
Here is a list of commands that we used in this workshop to navigate Git and GitHub in your command line: 

`cd [name of directory or folder]` will navigate you into the directory you identified.

`cd ..` will navigate you up a directory.

`cd -` goes back to the last directory you were in.

`pwd` or "print working directory" will tell you where you are if you get a little lost.

`mkdir [name]` makes a new directory.

`git init` (initiates git for this directory).

`touch [name].md` makes a new markdown file, which is plain text, in whatever directory you're in in the command line. 

`open [name].[extension]` lets you open a file and begin editing it. 

`git status` checks the status of your commits. Use often!

`git add [filename].[extension]` stages the file.

`git commit -a` or `git commit -m "(text)"` commits the changes. 

`git push -u origin master` pushes commits to the master branch.

`git pull [URL of remote repo]` updates your local repo with remote changes. 

`git clone [URL of remote repo]` makes a local copy of a repo for you to edit.
